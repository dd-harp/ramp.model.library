# 

The SIS model, as it is now called, is a simple compartmental model, first introduced by Ross. It is included in `exDE` as a base model. 

### Variables

+ $I$ is the density of infected humans

+ $H$ is the density of humans

### Parameters

+ $r$ is the rate infections clear

+ $b$ is the fraction of bites by infective mosquitoes that transmit parasites and cause an infection. 

+ $c$ is the fraction of bites on an infectious human that would infect a mosquito. 

### Dynamics

The model defined herein is defined in two parts. To model exposure and infection (*i.e.* the conversion of eir into foi), we assume that the fraction of infective bites that cause an infection is $b$. The dynamics are given by: 

$$
\frac{dI}{dt} = h (H-I)-rI
$$

### Terms 

**Net Infectiousness**

True prevalence is:

$$x = \frac{X}{H}.$$ 

In our implementation, net infectiousness (NI) is linearly proportional to prevalence:

$$c x.$$

**Human Transmitting Capacity**

After exposure, a human would remain infected for $1/r$ days, transmitting with probability $c$ so:

$$c/r$$

**Exposure and Infection**

In this model family, there is no immunity. The model assumes that a constant fraction of all infectious bites, $b$, cause an infection.
